                            Aquarius is an equatorial constellation of the zodiac. It is one of the oldest recognized constellations, yet because of its fainter stars it is somewhat
                            insignificant compared to other constellations.
                            It lies in a region often called the Sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as Cetus the whale, Pisces the fish and Eridanus the river.

                            In ancient Mesopotamia the constellation had a significant role as it lies on the yearly path of the Sun. It was identified as GU.LA "The Great One"
                            in the Babylonian star catalogues. It represented the god Ea in the Akkadian religion (also known as Enki in the sumerian legends), the god of water, crafts and creation,
                            also one of the Annunnaki, a group of deities of the ancient Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians and Babylonians.
                            <br>
                            In Greek mythology, Aquarius is sometimes associated with Deucalion, who built a ship with his wife Pyrrha to survive a flood, that Zeus sent to the world to wipe out
                            the evil mankind. They sailed for nine days before washing ashore on Mount Parnassus, and recreated humanity with the help of the gods by throwing Gaia's bones behind their backs.
                            Aquarius also appeared in the ancient Egyptian astronomy, and was associated with the annual flood of the Nile.

                        Messier 2 is a globular cluster located around 55.000 light years from Earth. Binoculars or a small telescope will identify it as a bright spot of light,
                        while larger telescopes will resolve individual stars.

                        The Saturn Nebula is a planetary nebula (a type of emission nebula consisting of an expanding ionized gas cloud ejected from red giant stars late in their lives)
                        Which got its name from its vague resemblance to the planet Saturn with its rings. It appears as greenish-yellowish in amateur telescopes.

                        The Helix Nebula is a planetary nebula which is one of the closest deep-sky object of this type, lying only 650 light years away. It covers a huge area in the sky
                        and can be best observed with smaller telescopes. It has sometimes been referred to as the "Eye of God" in pop culture, as well as the "Eye of Sauron" due to its distinctive shape.
