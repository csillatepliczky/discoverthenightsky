                            Lying between Leo to the west and Libra to the east, Virgo is one of the constellations of the zodiac and the second-largest constellation in the sky.
                            It is prominent in the spring sky in the northern hemisphere, visible all night in March and April, and can be easily found through is brightest star, Spica.
                            As the largest zodiac constellation, the Sun takes 44 days to pass through it, longer than any other. It was originally a smaller constellation but
                            was extended with some fainter stars on its eastern side in 1928. The constellation is rich in galaxies and galaxy clusters (the most prominent one being the Virgo Cluster).

                            The constellation had a significant meaning in the ancient times because here was the point of the autumnal equinox in the 2nd and 1st century B.C.
                            When it rose in March above the horizon, it was a sign of spring and fertility of the lands. That's why it became associated in many cultures not with virginity but with the goddess of wheat, agriculture and fertility.
                            In Egypt it was associated with Isis, in Babylon with Ishtar. Greek astronomy depicted the constellation as Demeter, goddess of the harvest and agriculture,
                            later as Dike, the goddess of justice holding the scales of justice. The Romans associated it with their goddess Ceres
                            but sometimes it was referred to as as the virgin goddess Iustitia. However during the Middle Ages, Virgo became associated with the Blessed Virgin Mary.

                        Spica is the brightest star of the constellation and one of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky with a brightness of around 1 magnitude. It is located around
                        250 light years from Earth, and has a surface brightness of 2.000 times higher than the Sun.

                        Messier 87 is az elliptical galaxy, one of the largest and most massive known galaxies that contains several trillion stars. It has many globular clusters,
                        and also ejects a jet of energetic plasma that originates from the core. It has also many satellite galaxies.
                        It is one of the brightest radio sources in the sky and a popular target for both amateur and professional astronomers.

                        Messier 84 is a huge elliptical or lenticular galaxy about 55 million light years away from Earth. It is part of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies and also one of the
                        brightest members of the Markarian's Chain, a cluster of galaxies forming a distinctive chain shape. The larger members of the chain are also visible through
                        smaller telescopes.

                        Messier 86 is also an elliptical or lenticular galaxy so close to M84 that they can be seen in the same field of view in smaller telescopes.
                        It lies in the center of the Virgo Cluster and is also a large and bright member of the Markarian's Chain.
