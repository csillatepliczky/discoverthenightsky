                            Ursa Major, also known as the Great Bear is one of the most well-known constellations in the northern sky. It is circumpolar from the most parts of the northern hemisphere
                            (i.e. it is visible during the whole year) and it is easily recognisable by the asterism of its main seven stars,
                            which has been called the "Big Dipper", "the Wagon", "Charles's Wain", or "the Plough", among other names. Due to its bright and conspicuous stars its
                            associated mythology likely dates back into prehistory. It was already known and used for navigation and measuring time during the night in various parts of Africa,
                            Egypt, India and the Arabian Peninsula.

                            Originally the seven stars of the Big Dipper formed the constellation but later the Greeks and the Romans attached the fainter stars lying south to it, thus
                            forming the shape of the Bear. It was depicted in the Greek mythology as a young woman named Callisto, a nymph of Artemis. She had a son named Arcas as the result of her rape by Zeus.
                            When Hera, Zeus's wife discovered it, she transformed her into a bear in her jealous rage. The constellation also appears in Hindu and East-Asian traditions.

                            Ursa Major is among the few star groups that is mentioned in the Bible (Job 9:9; 38:32).

                        Mizar and Alcor are a famous naked eye double stars which are located in the middle of the "handle" of the Big Dipper. However, it has yet to be proven conclusively that they are gravitationally bound,
                        so we are not sure yet, whether they are a real binary system or not. But research has shown that they lie about the same distance from Earth and move in the same direction in the sky.
                        Both of them are actual multiple star systems on their own, Mizar has three, Alcor has one companion star.

                    <p>
                        M81 and M82 are a pair of galaxies roughly 11.8 million light years away from Earth. M81 is a spiral galaxy (its shape can be similar to the Milky Way from an outside perpesctive),
                        while M82 is an irregular galaxy with a starburst activity in its middle part. The two galaxies are gravitationally bound together, and have affected the shape of one another.
                        Even in a bigger (for example 20 cm in diameter) telescope they can be fit in the same field of view and thus are a spectacular sight.

                        M101 is a large spiral galaxy with a diameter of 170.000 light years. It lies about 16 million light years from Earth which makes it one of the closest spiral galaxies.
                        It has six companion galaxies and together they form the M101 Group.
