                            Perseus is a constellation in the northern sky near the northern celestial pole, named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus.
                            He is the hero of the <a href="/andromeda">Andromeda</a>-myth, who saved Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus, and later married her.
                            The galactic plane of the Milky Way passes through the constellation, making it home to many deep-sky objects.
                            It hosts the radiant of the annual Perseids meteor shower in every August, which is one of the most spectacular meteor showers in the sky.

                            Perseus was a prominent figure in the Greek mythology, who had an adventurous life (the Andromeda-myth was only one of his many adventures).
                            His mother was Danae, daughter of Argos and his father was Zeus himself. When Argos received a prophecy, that he was going to be killed by his own grandson,
                            he throwed Danae and her son into the sea. But they were rescued and provided shelter by the people of Seriphos island, where Perseus grew up and became a hero.
                            <br>
                            One of his adventures he was sent by the king of Seriphos to bring him the head of Medusa the Gorgon - whose visage caused all who gazed upon her to turn to stone.
                            He was aided by the gods, who gave him a diamond sword, a helm of darkness to hide, a pair of winged sandals and a polished shield. In the cave he came upon the sleeping Medusa.
                            By viewing Medusa's reflection in his polished shield, he safely approached and cut off her head.

                        The second brightest star of the constellation called Algol is actually a three-star system and one of the first non-nova variable stars to be discovered.
                        Its magnitude drops from 2.1 to 3.4 in every two days, 20 hours and 48 minutes, as one of the fainter stars in the system passes before the brightest one,
                        causing an eclipse.

                        M34 is a large, bright and relatively near open cluster, lying 1.500 light years away from Earth.
                        The cluster is just visible to the naked eye in very dark conditions, but can be better observed with binoculars.

                        The Double Cluster consists of the open clusters NGC 869 and NGC 884 which lie close together in the sky, making them one of the most beautiful
                        and distinctive open clusters. Both visible with the naked eye, they are about 7.500 light years away from Earth.
