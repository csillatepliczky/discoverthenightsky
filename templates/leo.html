                            Leo is one of the constellations of the zodiac, between Cancer to the west and Virgo to the east.
                            It is easily recognizable due to its many bright stars and a distinctive shape reminiscent of a crouching lion. It was already known in the
                            ancient times but some stars were added to the southern part of the constellation in 1928. The constellation is rich in deep-sky objects, particularly galaxies.

                            In ancient Mesopotamia only Regulus (Latin for 'prince' or 'little king', also its ancient name, Sharru means 'king' in Mesopotamian) was known as the point of the summer solstice.
                            Later some stars were included and it was completed to a constellation. Leo was also associated in ancient cultures
                            with the great power of the Sun and the might of the kings and rulers, as the most powerful animal was known to be the lion.

                            In Babylonian astronomy, the constellation was called UR.GU.LA, the "Great Lion"; the bright star Regulus was known as "the star that stands at the Lion's breast."
                            In Egypt it was called "the house of the Sun" and it was the symbol of water and fire. In Greek mythology,
                            Leo was identified as the Nemean Lion which was killed by Heracles (<a href="/hercules">Hercules</a>) with his bare hands in the first of his Twelve Labours.

                        Leo Triplet is a small group of spiral galaxies consisting of three members: M65, M66 and NGC 3628. They are about 35 million light-years away from Earth
                        and also physically close to each other in space. They can be best observed with telescopes, and are also a popular target for astrophotographers due to their
                        unique formation.
